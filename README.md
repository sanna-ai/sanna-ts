# Sanna — Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents

Sanna checks reasoning during execution, halts when constraints are violated, and generates portable cryptographic receipts proving governance was enforced. Constitution-as-code: your governance rules live in version-controlled YAML, not in a vendor dashboard.

This is the **TypeScript implementation** of [Sanna Protocol v1.0](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-protocol). For the Python reference implementation, see [sanna-ai/sanna](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna).

## v1.3.0 Release Notes

**Receipt Schema v1.3** — 16-field fingerprint (up from 14), adding `enforcement_surface` and `invariants_scope` as required fields. The verifier now enforces these fields and the 4-action status override (halted→FAIL, warned→WARN, escalated→WARN) at verification time as well as at emission time.

**New receipt fields:**
- `parent_receipts` — array of parent receipt fingerprints for causal chaining (e.g., escalation → execution)
- `workflow_id` — per-session identifier for grouping related receipts across a workflow
- `content_mode` / `content_mode_source` — attestation of what content mode (full, redacted, hashes_only) was active and where it was configured

**ReceiptSink architecture** — pluggable receipt delivery replacing direct SQLite coupling:
- `CloudHTTPSink` — HTTPS delivery with retry, exponential backoff, batch support, and buffer-and-retry via JSONL
- `CompositeSink` — fan-out to multiple sinks with `Promise.allSettled()` failure isolation
- `LocalSQLiteSink` — wraps `ReceiptStore` as a `ReceiptSink` for backward compatibility
- `NullSink` — no-op sink for testing

**Gateway receipt chaining** — escalation receipts are automatically linked as parents when the escalated tool call is approved and executed. Per-session `workflow_id` groups all receipts within a gateway session.

**Content mode attestation** — gateway records which `content_mode` is active and its source in receipt metadata.

**926 tests across 48 files** (up from 771 across 44).

## Quick Start — Library Mode

```bash
npm install @sanna-ai/core
```

Set up governance (one-time):

```bash
sanna init         # Choose template, set agent name, enforcement level
sanna keygen       # Generate Ed25519 keypair (~/.sanna/keys/)
# Output:
#   Generated Ed25519 keypair (a1b2c3d4e5f6...)
#   Private key: /Users/you/.sanna/keys/a1b2c3d4e5f6...7890.key
#   Public key:  /Users/you/.sanna/keys/a1b2c3d4e5f6...7890.pub
sanna sign constitution.yaml --private-key ~/.sanna/keys/<key-id>.key
```

Now wrap the functions you want to govern. `sannaObserve` wraps the functions you choose — internal reasoning, prompt construction, and non-governed function calls produce no receipts.

```typescript
import { sannaObserve, SannaHaltError } from "@sanna-ai/core";
import type { SannaResult } from "@sanna-ai/core";

const myAgent = sannaObserve(
  (query: string, context: string): string => {
    return "Based on the data, revenue grew 12% year-over-year.";
  },
  {
    constitutionPath: "constitution.yaml",
    constitutionPublicKeyPath: "~/.sanna/keys/<key-id>.pub",  // from sanna keygen above
  },
);

// sannaObserve wraps the return value in a SannaResult with .output and .receipt.
// The original string return is available as result.output.
try {
  const result: SannaResult<string> = myAgent(
    "What was revenue growth?",
    "Annual report: revenue increased 12% YoY to $4.2B.",
  );
  console.log(result.output);   // The original string return value
  console.log(result.receipt);  // Cryptographic governance receipt
  // To persist receipts, use ReceiptStore separately:
  //   import { ReceiptStore } from "@sanna-ai/core";
  //   const store = new ReceiptStore(".sanna/receipts.db");
  //   store.save(result.receipt);
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof SannaHaltError) {
    console.error(`HALTED: ${e.message}`);  // Constitution violation detected
  }
}
```

## Quick Start — Gateway Mode

No code changes to your agent. The gateway sits between your MCP client and downstream servers.

```bash
npm install @sanna-ai/gateway

sanna init         # Creates constitution.yaml + gateway.yaml
sanna keygen --label gateway
sanna sign constitution.yaml --private-key ~/.sanna/keys/<key-id>.key
sanna gateway gateway.yaml
```

Minimum `gateway.yaml`:

```yaml
gateway:
  constitution:
    path: ./constitution.yaml
  enforcement:
    mode: enforced
    default_policy: deny

downstreams:
  - name: notion
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"]
    env:
      OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS: "${OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS}"
```

Point your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) at the gateway instead of directly at your downstream servers. Every tool call is now governed. The gateway governs tool calls that pass through it — only actions that cross the governance boundary produce receipts. Reasoning is captured via the explicit `_justification` parameter in tool calls, not from internal model reasoning. The gateway cannot observe LLM chain-of-thought.

```
MCP Client (Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor)
        |
        v  (MCP stdio)
sanna-gateway
        |  1. Receive tool call
        |  2. Evaluate against constitution
        |  3. Enforce policy (allow / escalate / deny)
        |  4. Generate signed receipt
        |  5. Forward to downstream (if allowed)
        v  (MCP stdio)
Downstream MCP Servers (Notion, GitHub, filesystem, etc.)
```

## Demo

Run a self-contained governance demo — no external dependencies:

```bash
sanna demo
```

This generates keys, creates a constitution, simulates a governed tool call, generates a receipt, and verifies it.

## Core Concepts

**Constitution** — YAML document defining what the agent can, cannot, and must escalate. Ed25519-signed. Modification after signing is detected on load. Constitution signing (via `sanna sign`) is required for enforcement. Constitution approval is an optional additional governance step for multi-party review workflows.

**Receipt** — JSON artifact binding inputs, reasoning, action, and check results into a cryptographically signed, schema-validated, deterministically fingerprinted record. Receipts are generated per governed action — when an agent calls a tool or executes a wrapped function — not per conversational turn. An agent that reasons for twenty turns and executes one action produces one receipt.

**Coherence Checks (C1-C5)** — Five built-in deterministic heuristics. No API calls or external dependencies.

| Check | Invariant | What it catches |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| C1 | `INV_NO_FABRICATION` | Output contradicts provided context |
| C2 | `INV_MARK_INFERENCE` | Definitive claims without hedging |
| C3 | `INV_NO_FALSE_CERTAINTY` | Confidence exceeding evidence strength |
| C4 | `INV_PRESERVE_TENSION` | Conflicting information collapsed |
| C5 | `INV_NO_PREMATURE_COMPRESSION` | Complex input reduced to single sentence |

**Authority Boundaries** — `can_execute` (forward), `must_escalate` (prompt user), `cannot_execute` (deny). Policy cascade: per-tool override > server default > constitution.

**Key Management** — Public keys are stored in `~/.sanna/keys/` and referenced by their key ID (SHA-256 fingerprint of the public key). For verification, pass the public key path explicitly via `--public-key` on the CLI or `constitutionPublicKeyPath` in code.

## Receipt Format

Every governed action produces a reasoning receipt — a JSON artifact that cryptographically binds inputs, outputs, check results, and constitution provenance. See the [Sanna Protocol specification](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-protocol) for the full specification.

Minimal example receipt (abbreviated — production receipts typically contain 3-7 checks):

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.3",
  "tool_version": "sanna-ts/1.3.0",
  "checks_version": "8",
  "receipt_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d",

}
```

## Constitution Format

Constitutions are YAML documents that define an agent's governance boundaries. They are version-controlled, cryptographically signed (and optionally approved) before enforcement.

```yaml
sanna_constitution: "1.1"

identity:
  agent_name: support-agent
  domain: customer-support
  description: Handles refund and billing inquiries

provenance:
  authored_by: governance-team
  approved_by: vp-risk
  approval_date: "2026-01-15"

boundaries:
  - id: B1
    description: Only answer questions about products in the catalog
    category: scope
    severity: critical
  - id: B2
    description: Never promise refunds outside the 30-day window
    category: policy
    severity: critical

invariants:
  - id: INV_NO_FABRICATION
    rule: Never state facts not grounded in provided context
    enforcement: critical
  - id: INV_MARK_INFERENCE
    rule: Clearly mark any inference or assumption
    enforcement: warning
  - id: INV_NO_FALSE_CERTAINTY
    rule: Do not express certainty beyond what evidence supports
    enforcement: warning
  - id: INV_PRESERVE_TENSION
    rule: When context contains conflicting rules, surface both
    enforcement: warning
  - id: INV_NO_PREMATURE_COMPRESSION
    rule: Do not over-summarize multi-faceted context
    enforcement: warning

authority_boundaries:
  can_execute:
    - Look up order status
    - Search knowledge base
  must_escalate:
    - Issue refund over $500
    - Override account restrictions
  cannot_execute:
    - Delete customer accounts
    - Access payment credentials

escalation_targets:
  - condition: "refund over limit"
    target:
      type: webhook
      url: https://ops.example.com/escalate

reasoning:
  require_justification: true
  assurance_level: full
```

## Custom Invariant Checks

Invariants defined in your constitution YAML are automatically detected and enforced. Sanna maps rule text to built-in check types:

| Type | Detected when rule contains | Example |
|------|---------------------------|---------|
| `pii_detection` | "PII" | `No PII in output` |
| `max_length` | "maximum" + number + "characters" | `Maximum 500 characters per response` |
| `regex_match` | "must match" + `/pattern/` | `Output must match /^\d{4}-\d{2}$/` |
| `regex_deny` | "must not match" + `/pattern/` | `Must not match /password:\s*.+/` |
| `required_keywords` | "must contain" + quoted words | `Output must contain 'disclaimer', 'terms'` |

```typescript
import { loadConstitution, runAllInvariantChecks } from "@sanna-ai/core";

const constitution = loadConstitution("constitution.yaml");
const output = "Here is the response from the agent.";

const results = runAllInvariantChecks(constitution, output);
for (const result of results) {
  console.log(`${result.check_id}: ${result.passed ? "PASS" : "FAIL"}`);
  if (!result.passed) {
    console.log(`  Evidence: ${result.evidence}`);
  }
}
```

Invariants with explicit `check` fields (e.g., `check: sanna.context_contradiction`) skip type detection and are handled by the coherence check engine. Unrecognized rules return `NOT_CHECKED` status — they are not silently ignored.

Regex patterns are validated by [safe-regex2](https://github.com/fastify/safe-regex2) before execution. Catastrophic backtracking patterns (e.g., `(a+)+`) are rejected with `UNSAFE_PATTERN` status and fail-open.

## Receipt Querying

```typescript
import { ReceiptStore, DriftAnalyzer } from "@sanna-ai/core";

const store = new ReceiptStore(".sanna/receipts.db");

// Query with filters
const receipts = store.query({
  agent_id: "support-agent",
  status: "FAIL",
  limit: 10,
});

// Drift analysis
const analyzer = new DriftAnalyzer(store);
const report = analyzer.analyze(30, { threshold: 0.15 });

store.close();
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
sanna drift-report --db .sanna/receipts.db --window 30 --json
```

## Constitution Templates

`sanna init` offers four templates:

| Template | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Developer | Advisory enforcement, starter template for development |
| Production | Strict enforcement, full governance for production agents |
| Privacy-Focused | PII-aware, data handling boundaries |
| Minimal | Bare minimum constitution for custom configuration |

### Gateway Constitution Templates

Six ready-to-use constitution templates for gateway deployments live in [`examples/constitutions/`](examples/constitutions/). Each includes evaluation order documentation explaining how `cannot_execute`, `must_escalate`, and `can_execute` interact.

| Template | Agent | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| [`openclaw-developer`](examples/constitutions/openclaw-developer.yaml) | openclaw-developer | Development agent with full workspace access, escalation for dangerous patterns |
| [`openclaw-personal`](examples/constitutions/openclaw-personal.yaml) | openclaw-personal | Personal productivity agent with broad file and execution access |
| [`openclaw-team`](examples/constitutions/openclaw-team.yaml) | openclaw-team | Shared team agent with strict governance, file modifications require escalation |
| [`cowork-personal`](examples/constitutions/cowork-personal.yaml) | knowledge-worker-agent | Knowledge workers using Cowork / Claude Desktop with MCP servers |
| [`cowork-team`](examples/constitutions/cowork-team.yaml) | team-workspace-agent | Small teams sharing governance via Git with per-developer sidecars |
| [`claude-code-standard`](examples/constitutions/claude-code-standard.yaml) | claude-code-agent | Developers using Claude Code with MCP connectors |

  SannaHaltError,

  // Receipts
  generateReceipt,
  signReceipt,
  verifyReceipt,
  computeFingerprints,

  // Checks
  runCoherenceChecks,
  loadInvariantChecks,
  runAllInvariantChecks,

  // Cryptography
  generateKeypair,
  sign,
  verify,
  loadPrivateKey,

  createIdentityClaim,
  verifyIdentityClaim,
  IdentityRegistry,

  // Safe I/O
  safeWriteFile,
  safeWriteJson,
  safeReadFile,
  validatePath,
} from "@sanna-ai/core";
```

Type imports for advanced usage:

```typescript
import type {
  Constitution,
  Receipt,
  CheckResult,
  AuthorityDecision,
  SannaResult,
  SannaObserveOptions,
  ReceiptQueryFilters,
  DriftReport,
  EnforcementMode,
  InvariantDefinition,
  ReceiptSink,
  SinkResult,
  ContentMode,
  FailurePolicy,
  CloudHTTPSinkOptions,
} from "@sanna-ai/core";
```

## Verification

Verification proves four properties:

- **Schema validation:** Receipt structure matches the expected format.
- **Hash verification:** Content hashes match the actual inputs and outputs (tamper detection).
- **Signature verification:** Receipt was signed by a known key (authenticity).
- **Chain verification:** Constitution was signed, and any approvals are cryptographically bound.

```bash
# Verify receipt integrity
sanna verify receipt.json

# Verify with signature check
sanna verify receipt.json --public-key <key-id>.pub

# Verify constitution signature
sanna verify-constitution constitution.yaml --public-key <key-id>.pub
```

Programmatic verification:

```typescript
import { verifyReceipt, loadPublicKey } from "@sanna-ai/core";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const receipt = JSON.parse(readFileSync("receipt.json", "utf-8"));
const publicKey = loadPublicKey("~/.sanna/keys/<key-id>.pub");

const result = verifyReceipt(receipt, publicKey);
console.log(result.valid);            // true or false
console.log(result.checks_performed); // list of verification steps
```

Evidence bundles package a receipt, its constitution, and public keys into a self-contained zip for auditors:

```typescript
import { createBundle, verifyBundle } from "@sanna-ai/core";

// Create bundle
await createBundle({
  receiptPath: "receipt.json",
  constitutionPath: "constitution.yaml",
  publicKeyPath: "~/.sanna/keys/<key-id>.pub",
  outputPath: "evidence.zip",
});

// Verify bundle (7-step verification)
const result = verifyBundle("evidence.zip");
console.log(result.passed);  // true if all 7 checks pass
```

No network. No API keys. No vendor dependency.

## Enterprise Features

- **DMARC-style adoption**: Start with `permissive` enforcement (observe), move to `advisory` (warn), then `enforced` (halt).
- **Ed25519 cryptographic signatures**: Constitutions, receipts, and approval records are independently signed and verifiable.
- **Offline verification**: No platform dependency. Verify receipts with a public key and the CLI.
- **Evidence bundles**: Self-contained zip archives with receipt, constitution, and public keys for auditors.
- **Drift analytics**: Per-agent failure-rate trending with linear regression and breach projection.
- **Receipt Triad**: Cryptographic binding of input, reasoning, and action for auditability.
- **Receipt queries**: SQLite-backed receipt persistence with filtered queries via `ReceiptStore`.
- **Key management**: SHA-256 key fingerprints, labeled keypairs, PKCS#8/SPKI PEM format.
- **Multi-party approval**: Quorum-based constitution approval workflows with expiration and cryptographic binding.
- **MCP governance tools**: 10 governance tools available via MCP stdio for integration with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor.
- **Receipt sinks**: Pluggable receipt delivery — `CloudHTTPSink` (HTTPS with retry/batch/buffer), `CompositeSink` (fan-out), `LocalSQLiteSink`, `NullSink`.
- **Receipt chaining**: Causal linking via `parent_receipts` (e.g., escalation → execution) with per-session `workflow_id` correlation.
- **Content mode attestation**: Gateway records active content mode and its configuration source in receipt metadata.

## Security

- **Ed25519 cryptographic signatures**: Constitutions, receipts, and approval records are independently signed and verifiable offline.
- **Atomic file writes**: All file operations use symlink-protected atomic writes (temp file + `fsync` + rename).
- **SQLite hardening**: Receipt stores validate file ownership, enforce `0o600` permissions, and reject symlinks.
- **Safe regex execution**: User-supplied regex patterns are validated by [safe-regex2](https://github.com/fastify/safe-regex2) before execution. Catastrophic backtracking patterns are rejected.
- **PII redaction**: Credit card detection uses a two-pass approach (strip separators, match digit runs) to avoid ReDoS. Object redaction enforces a recursion depth limit (default 20) to prevent stack overflow.
- **Escalation token hashing**: Only SHA-256 hashes of HMAC tokens are stored at rest. Raw tokens are returned to the caller but never persisted.
- **Config secret isolation**: Gateway config supports `$ENV{VAR_NAME}` interpolation for HMAC secrets and key paths. File permission warnings on group/world-readable config files.
- **Path validation**: File I/O validates against symlink attacks, path traversal, and excessively large files.
- **CloudHTTPSink hardening**: Non-retryable status codes (400/401/403) fail immediately. 429 respects `Retry-After`. Buffer-and-retry via JSONL with background flush interval.

## Cryptographic Design

- **Signing**: Ed25519 over canonical JSON (RFC 8785-style deterministic serialization)
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for all content hashes, fingerprints, and key IDs
- **Canonicalization**: Sorted keys, NFC Unicode normalization, integer-only numerics (no floats in signed content)
- **Fingerprinting**: 14 pipe-delimited fields hashed with SHA-256; 16-hex truncation for display, 64-hex for full fingerprint

See the [Sanna Protocol specification](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-protocol) for full cryptographic construction details.

## Threat Model

**Defends against:**
- Tampering with stored receipts (detected via fingerprint and signature verification)
- Unverifiable governance claims (receipts are cryptographically signed attestations)
- Substitution of receipts across contexts (receipts are cryptographically bound to specific inputs, outputs, and correlation IDs; verifiers should enforce timestamp and correlation expectations)
- Unauthorized tool execution (constitution enforcement blocks or escalates disallowed actions)

**Does not defend against:**
- Compromised runtime environment (if the host is compromised, all bets are off)
- Stolen signing keys (key compromise requires re-keying and re-signing)
- Bypassing Sanna entirely (governance only applies to functions wrapped with `sannaObserve` or tool calls routed through the gateway)
- Malicious constitutions (Sanna enforces the constitution as written; it does not validate whether the constitution itself is correct or sufficient)

## Limitations

Receipts are attestations of process, not guarantees of outcome.

- Receipts do not prove internal reasoning was truthful — they prove that checks were run against the output
- Receipts do not prove upstream input was complete or accurate
- Receipts do not protect against a compromised host or stolen signing keys
- Receipts do not prove the constitution itself was correct or sufficient for the use case
- Heuristic checks (C1-C5) are deterministic but not exhaustive — they catch common failure modes, not all possible failures

## Cross-Language Compatibility

Receipts generated by the TypeScript SDK verify in the [Python SDK](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna), and vice versa. Key pairs are interchangeable — both SDKs use PKCS#8 (private) and SPKI (public) PEM encoding for Ed25519 keys.

Cross-language parity is verified against golden fixtures in the [sanna-protocol](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-protocol) repository. The test suite includes cross-language verification tests covering receipt fingerprinting, content hashing, canonicalization, and signature verification. v1.3 Python fixtures (16-field fingerprint, checks_version "8") are verified end-to-end including enforcement_surface and invariants_scope; v1.3 TypeScript receipts use the same 16-field fingerprint formula.

```typescript
// Keys generated by the Python SDK work in TypeScript
import { loadPublicKey, verifyReceipt } from "@sanna-ai/core";

const pythonKey = loadPublicKey("python-generated-key.pub");
const pythonReceipt = JSON.parse(readFileSync("python-receipt.json", "utf-8"));
const result = verifyReceipt(pythonReceipt, pythonKey);
// result.valid === true
```

## Install

```bash
npm install @sanna-ai/core           # Core library
npm install @sanna-ai/cli            # CLI tools (includes core)
npm install @sanna-ai/mcp-server     # MCP governance server
npm install @sanna-ai/gateway        # MCP enforcement proxy
```

Requires **Node.js 22+** for native Ed25519 support (zero external crypto dependencies).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-ts.git
cd sanna-ts
git submodule update --init        # Pull sanna-protocol spec fixtures
npm install                        # Workspaces auto-linked
npm run build                      # Build all 4 packages
npm test                           # 926 tests across 48 test files
```

The `spec/` git submodule points to [sanna-ai/sanna-protocol](https://github.com/sanna-ai/sanna-protocol) and provides golden fixtures, JSON schemas, and the protocol specification used by the cross-language test suite.
